- The JS frontend lives in the snacks subdirectory.
  - This uses pnpm as a package manager.
- The Elixir/Phoenix backend lives in the fridge subdirectory.
- Actions specific to the frontend or backend subprojects should happen
  in the appropriate directories. Specifically, run a command like
  "mix test" with "cd fridge && mix test" or "pnpm install" with 
  "cd plate && pnpm install".
